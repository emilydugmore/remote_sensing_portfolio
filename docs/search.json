As informal settlements expand—often into “environmentally precarious” land near riverbanks—the risk to human life from extreme weather events has transitioned from a theoretical threat to a frequent reality. This assignment discusses how Remote Sensing (RS) can serve as the primary implementation tool for two landmark policies: the Climate Change Act (No. 22 of 2024) and the White Paper for Human Settlements (2025).\n\n3.2.1 The Policy Mandates\n\nThe Climate Change Act (2024): Specifically mandates that provincial and metropolitan municipalities must “identify and spatially map… risks, vulnerabilities, areas, ecosystems and communities” vulnerable to climate impacts.\nThe White Paper for Human Settlements (2025): Recognizes that settlements characterized by poverty and “underdevelopment” are the most vulnerable. It calls for the integration of “innovative systems” and “new technologies” to transition toward climate-resilient society.\n\nThe “implementation gap” exists because while the law mandates mapping, traditional ground-based survey methods are too slow to keep pace with informal urban growth.

Cities, towns, and rural settlements occupy large tracks of land. However, the relatively low density, mono-functional and sprawling settlement structure is unsustainable from an environmental perspective. Climate change has become one of the most critical developmental risks to South Africa with potential devastating economic, social, and ecological dimensions. Large parts of South Africa are already experiencing occurrences of unprecedented extreme weather events, ranging from severe storms, floods, fire, and drought. This is expected to accelerate over time. It affects both urban and rural settlements. Settlements characterised by massive poverty, service backlogs, underdevelopment and often located in areas that are not suitable for human habitation (such as informal and some rural settlements) are typically the most vulnerable. Increasingly, natural disasters, such as flooding, fires and drought are having a devastating effect on communities and there is an urgent need to address this and integrate climate-resilient and sustainable development approaches in human settlements.\nPolicy statements: Government will endeavour to integrate climate resilience and sustainable development approaches into the planning, design, construction, and operation of human settlements in an effort to avoid the devasting impacts of climate change. Integration will also ensure that valuable social, economic and environmental benefits from new technologies and approaches can be harnessed to support sustainable development. Government will commit to the development of a Human Settlements Climate Change Response Strategy and implementation plan to ensure that human Page 66 of 81 settlements policies, regulatory framework, and practice respond to the prevailing consequences arising from climate change. The strategy will contain both adaptation and mitigation measures and enable a process toward a just transition to a low carbon and climate resilient society currently underway in South Africa.",

    "text": "Active vs passive sensors\nPassive sensors rely on naturally available energy, primarily sunlight, and do not emit energy themselves. As solar electromagnetic radiation (EMR) travels through the atmosphere and reflects off the Earth’s surface, it undergoes several interactions, including absorption, transmission, and scattering. These interactions can significantly reduce the amount of energy that reaches the sensor. Consequently, passive sensors are ineffective in low-light conditions and are unable to penetrate obstacles such as clouds, smoke, or dense vegetation, as these features scatter or absorb the reflected radiation.\nActive sensors emit their own EMR and wait to receive the reflected energy. The emitted energy is often in the form of long wavelengths that are able to ‘pass through’ atmospheric obstacles which have smaller particle sizes (rather than being scattered, absorbed or reflected).\n\n\nSpectral Signatures\nSpectral signatures show how different materials reflect or absorb electromagnetic energy across a spectrum of wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum. Each feature on Earth has a unique spectral signature that is determined by physical and chemical properties and how it interacts with electromagnetic radiation.\n\nAn important feature in the spectral signature is the red edge - a sharp increase in reflectance around 700 nm in vegetation’s spectral signature, which indicates chlorophyll content and plant health.\n\n\nResolutions\nThe characteristics of remote sensors will determine the level of accuracy and detail of the information about the Earth’s surface.\n\nSpectral Resolution\nSpectral resolution refers to a sensor’s ability to distinguish between different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from the received signal. Each spectral band corresponds to a specific wavelength range, and averages its information across this range. Wider spectral bands reflect a lower spectral resolution. A higher number of bands reflects a higher spectral resolution.\nSometimes there are large gaps of wavelength ranges in the EMS in which no information is collected, and this is because the atmosphere does not allow certain wavelengths to pass. Thus, bands are often limited to atmospheric windows where wavelengths can penetrate.\n\n\n\nSpectral Resolutions of two satellites. Landsat 1 (MSS) has four spectral bands within the visible and near IR spectra, while Landsat 8 has 15 bands spread across the whole electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\nLooking more closely at the Landsat 1 (MSS) satellite…\nThe information captured by each of the four spectral bands are stored as a greyscale image, which shows the reflection intensity of the Earth’s surface within each band. By combining the refletance information from each band, and then comparing this with spectral signatures, we can distinguish features of the Earth’s surface.\n\n\n\n\nOther Resolutions\nSpatial = The size of the raster grid per pixel, from 10cm to several kilometers.\nTemporal = The time between revisits of information collection for a given location.\nRadiometric = The ability of a sensor to identify and show small differences in energy.\n*** Something about balancing / trade offs ***\n\n\n\nColour composites\nColour composites are images created by assigning different spectral bands to the red, green, and blue (RGB) display bands, and are used to highlight specific features that are often not visible to the human eye.\n\n\n\nComparison of the spectral resolutions of Landsat 7 & 8 with Sentinel-2\n\n\nTrue colour composites (B4, B3, B2 for Sentinel-2) display the Earth as we would see it with our eyes.\nFalse colour composites use non-visible bands in the near-infrared range alongside red and green (B8, B4, B3 for Sentinel-2) to provide information particularly useful for vegetation analysis. The choice of these three bands has to do with plants reflecting near-infrared and green light while absorbing red light (see spectral signatures for a reminder of this).\nExpanding on this a bit more, we can make scatterplots (called a spectral feature space) of two bands against one another to see how much of our study area is covered by different features (in this case, dense vs sparse vegetation and dry vs wet soil).\n\n\n\nSource: Remote Sensing 4113\n\n\nAtmospheric penetration composites (B12, B11, B8A for Sentinel-2) have no visible bands so that the image penetrate atmospheric particles and reduces the effect of atmospheric scattering. The resulting image from this composite shows vegetation as blue and urban areas as white/grey or cyan/purple.\n\n\nTasseled Cap function\nAlthough this isn’t a true colour composite, and rather acts more as a spectral index, it’s interpretation is somewhat similar.\nThe tasseled cap function is a spectral transformation that combines multiple spectral bands into three new composite layers - brightness, greenness, and wetness (which are assigned to the red, green and blue bands, respectively). The resulting image is a representation of different land cover types (red = urban structures, green = vegetation, blue = water/moisture).",

For ratio enhancements, the ratio largely depends on the spectral signature of the object or feature that you want to detect.\n\nNDVI\nThe Normalised Difference Vegetation Index is a enhancement ratio which utilizes the fact that healthy plants reflect lots of infrared wavelengths and absorb red wavelengths to highlight areas which have healthy vegetation.\n\\[\nNDVI = \\frac{NIR - Red}{NIR + Red}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue Range\nSurface / Land Cover Description\n\n\n\n\n-1 to 0\nWater bodies, snow, clouds, non-vegetated surfaces (e.g., buildings)\n\n\n0 to 0.1\nBarren areas, rocks, sand, or snow\n\n\n0.2 to 0.5\nSparse vegetation, shrubs, grasslands\n\n\n0.6 to 1.0\nDense, healthy vegetation\n\n\n\nSurprisingly,\n\n\nTexture\nTexture is an enhancement which measures the spatial variation of grey values between each pixel and the pixels that surround it.\n\n\nPrinciple Component Analysis\nPCA is a statistical method which reduces the huge amounts of imagery data (which is typical for multi-band satellite imagery with lots of spectral bands) into an uncorrelated, smaller dataset. The resulting first component (PC1) will capture most of the variance within the dataset, while retaining majority of the original information.\n\n\n. Leaf-Level vs. Canopy-Level Reflectance\nThe study emphasizes that different species have unique “spectral signatures” based on their leaf structure.\n\nThe “Fynbos” Connection: Just as the Amazonian species in the paper show varying reflectance based on leaf thickness and water content, Table Mountain’s Fynbos has small, leathery (sclerophyllous) leaves. These do not reflect Near-Infrared (NIR) light as strongly as the broad, lush leaves of the tropical species studied in the paper, naturally leading to a lower NDVI calculation.\n\n\n\n2. Spectral Overlap and “Confusion”\nThe paper discusses how similar spectral signatures between different plants (or plants and their backgrounds) can make it hard to distinguish them.\n\nThe Table Mountain Issue: On Table Mountain, the “signal” from the sparse Fynbos often mixes with the “signal” from the dark grey sandstone and shadows of the cliffs. The paper explores how dimensionality reduction (simplifying complex data) is needed to find the true signal. Without this, your NDVI is likely “diluted” by the rocky background.\n\n\n\nFire History: Fire is a major factor in the fynbos. The paper specifically shows a “sudden drop of NDVI followed by a gradual vegetation recovery” in areas where fires occurred. If your satellite scene was taken shortly after a fire, the NDVI would be significantly lower than the mountain’s “known” status as a biodiversity hotspot.\nVegetation Age: The paper uses vegetation age (calculated from fire scars) as a key environmental variable. Younger vegetation that is still recovering from a burn will have a much lower NDVI than mature fynbos.",

By overlaying a SAR-derived flood footprints onto current building footprints, we can identify which households are at the highest risk.\nIntegrating “Innovative Systems” (Terrain Analysis):\nTo support the White Paper’s goal of “climate-resilient planning,” a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be used to calculate the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). This allows the City of Johannesburg to predict where water will pool during a storm, enabling them to move from reactive disaster relief to proactive relocation of the most at-risk residents.\nDaily Change Detection (PlanetScope):\nPlanetScope provides daily 3-meter resolution imagery, with which we can apply automated Machine Learning (ML) classifier to automatically “flag” new shack footprints as they appear in high risk zones.\n\n\nReflections\nThrough this case study, I have learned that while South African policies like the Climate Change Act (2024) are legally progressive, they often lack the technical “how-to” for municipal officials. This leads to a cycle of “passing the buck” between different spheres of government.\nI now realize that Remote Sensing is not just a scientific tool, but a policy implementation tool. It provides a “standardized language” that bypasses bureaucratic ambiguity. For example, while a policy might vaguely call for “mapping,” a Sentinel-1 radar image provides indisputable, legal proof of where the water goes.\nFurthermore, I have reflected on the fact that technology alone isn’t enough; it must be integrated into systems like the NDHSMS (National Digital Human Settlements Management System) to ensure that the data actually leads to better infrastructure for people in places like Alexandra. This exercise has shown me that the “innovative systems” mentioned in the 2025 White Paper are only effective if they are used to bridge the gap between hard law and the daily reality of those living on the river’s edge.",
