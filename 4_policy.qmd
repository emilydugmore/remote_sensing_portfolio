# Applying RS to Climate Policy in South Africa {.unnumbered}

## Flooding in Informal Settlements

South Africa's informal settlement landscape is extremely complex, and is largely a byproduct of historical spatial inclusion, rapid urbanization and severe shortage of affordable formal housing. Land on floodplains or alongside steep riverbanks is not suitable for formal development due to safety and insurance regulations. However, in many of the country's metro cities (like Durban and Johannesburg), these areas which are 'unsuitable' for formal development often end up being occupied by poorer communities as a means of accessing the nearby urban economies. In addition, complete lack of municipal infrastructure in informal settlements can drive people closer to rivers for sanitation and domestic use (washing clothes and cleaning). These communities are among the most vulnerable groups in the country in terms of flooding risk and climate-driven disasters.

## Relevant Policies

South African Legislation has recently shifted toward a more proactive, data-driven, planning approach to managing climate risks like flooding. I am going to discuss two policy documents and the potential role of remote sensing in implementing them.

#### Climate Change Act (2024)

The Climate Change Act is a national act specifically mandating that provinces and municipalities "must identify and **spatially map**, within the sphere of operations of the province, district or metropolitan municipality, as the case may be, **risks**, **vulnerabilities**, areas, ecosystems and **communities that will arise**, or that are **vulnerable to the impacts of climate change**".

The phrasing of this mandate is pretty typical of South African governance, which is notoriously vague with how acts should be implemented and who is going to implement them, ultimately allowing different levels of government to pass the responsibility to someone else.

#### White Paper for Human Settlements (2025)

The White Paper for Human Settlements policy document states that "government will endeavour to integrate **climate resilience** and sustainable development approaches into the **planning, design, construction, and operation of human settlements** in an effort to avoid the devastating impacts of climate change".

Interestingly, this policy specifically mentions the integration of "innovative systems" and "new technologies" when

## Using Remote Sensing

The use of remote sensing could be used across the country to address the implementation gap that the vague phrasing of the Climate Change Act is bound to create. This would involve:

-   **Mapping "Vulnerable Communities" (Optical Data):**

    I would use **Sentinel-2 (10m)** imagery to calculate the **Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI)**. By comparing imagery from 2016 to 2026, we can detect "unmanaged expansion" into river buffers. This provides a digital, objective record of exactly which shacks have encroached into high-risk zones, removing the administrative guesswork mentioned earlier.

-   **Visualizing "Risks and Vulnerabilities" (Radar Data):**

    Because floods often occur under heavy cloud cover, I would use Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar). SAR data penetrates clouds to map the reflection of water. By overlaying a SAR-derived flood footprints onto current building footprints, we can identify which households are at the highest risk.

-   **Integrating "Innovative Systems" (Terrain Analysis):**

    To support the White Paper’s goal of "climate-resilient planning," a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be used to calculate the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI). This allows the City of Johannesburg to predict where water will pool during a storm, enabling them to move from reactive disaster relief to proactive relocation of the most at-risk residents.

-   **Daily Change Detection (PlanetScope):**

    PlanetScope provides daily 3-meter resolution imagery, with which we can apply automated Machine Learning (ML) classifier to automatically "flag" new shack footprints as they appear in high risk zones.

### **Reflections**

Through this case study, I have learned that while South African policies like the Climate Change Act (2024) are legally progressive, they often lack the technical "how-to" for municipal officials. This leads to a cycle of "passing the buck" between different spheres of government.

I now realize that Remote Sensing is not just a scientific tool, but a policy implementation tool. It provides a "standardized language" that bypasses bureaucratic ambiguity. For example, while a policy might vaguely call for "mapping," a Sentinel-1 radar image provides indisputable, legal proof of where the water goes.

Furthermore, I have reflected on the fact that technology alone isn't enough; it must be integrated into systems like the NDHSMS (National Digital Human Settlements Management System) to ensure that the data actually leads to better infrastructure for people in places like Alexandra. This exercise has shown me that the "innovative systems" mentioned in the 2025 White Paper are only effective if they are used to bridge the gap between hard law and the daily reality of those living on the river’s edge.
